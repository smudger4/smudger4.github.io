title: Nick's Indigo Plugins
---

I've written these plugins to extend the [Indigo Domotics Indigo](http://www.indigodomo.com/index.html) Mac home automation application to support a number of different external devices and services. Indigo Domotics now provide a [Plugin Store](http://www.indigodomo.com/pluginstore/) to collate all of the publically available plugins: these all appear in the store.

# IP9258

[The IP9258 plugin](https://smudger4.github.io/Indigo-IP9258/) adds support for the [AVIOSYS IP9258](http://www.aviosys.com/9258.html) 4 outlet Ethernet power distribution switch.

# NetworkOwl

[The NetworkOwl plugin](https://smudger4.github.io/NetworkOwl/) reads electricity consumption & solar generation data from a NetworkOwl device & makes it available to Indigo.

# Eversolar Monitor

The [Eversolar Monitor Indigo plugin](https://smudger4.github.io/EversolarMonitor/) connects to a local [Eversolar Monitor](https://github.com/solmoller/eversolar-monitor/) solar PV interface application & reads electricity generation information into Indigo for use by other Indigo scripts.

# Coming soon

More of my plugins being added to the plugin store soon:
