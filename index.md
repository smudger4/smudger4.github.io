I've written these plugins to extend the [Indigo Domotics Indigo](http://www.indigodomo.com/index.html) Mac home automation application to support a number of different external devices and services. Indigo Domotics now provide a [Plugin Store](http://www.indigodomo.com/pluginstore/) to collate all of the publically available plugins: these appear in there.

# IP9258

[This plugin](https://smudger4.github.io/Indigo-IP9258/) adds support for the [AVIOSYS IP9258](http://www.aviosys.com/9258.html) 4 outlet Ethernet power distribution switch.

# NetworkOwl

[This plugin](https://smudger4.github.io/NetworkOwl/) reads electricity consumption & solar generation data from a NetworkOwl device & makes it available to Indigo

# Coming soon

More of my plugins being added to the plugin store soon:

* Eversolar Monitor
* Hive
* Alexa
